## Overview

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React web application, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) provides themeable styling and a set of common components.
- [React-USWDS](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds) provides React components already with USWDS theming out of the box. For a reference point starting out, see `react-uswds-hello.tsx` which includes examples of react-uswds component usage.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is included as a frontend workshop.

## üíª Development

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) provides the React framework for building the web application. Pages are defined in the `pages/` directory. Pages are automatically routed based on the file name. For example, `pages/index.tsx` is the home page.

Files in the `pages/api` are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). An example can be accessed at [localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) when running locally.

### Getting started

The application can be ran natively or in a Docker container.

#### Native

From the `app/` directory:

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
1. Optionally, disable [telemetry data collection](https://nextjs.org/telemetry)
   ```bash
   npx next telemetry disable
   ```
1. Run the local development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
1. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application

##### Other scripts

- `npm run build` - Builds the production Next.js bundle
- `npm start` - Runs the Next.js server, after building the production bundle

#### Docker

Alternatively, you can run the application in a Docker container.

From the `app/` directory:

1. Run the local development server
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
1. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application

##### Other scripts

- `make release-build` - Creates the Docker image for deployment to the cloud

## üñºÔ∏è Storybook

Storybook is a [frontend workshop](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-frontend-workshop-environment/) for developing and documenting pages and components in isolation. It allows you to render the same React components and files in the `src/` directory in a browser, without the need for a server or database. This allows you to develop and manually test components without having to run the entire Next.js application.

See the [Storybook Next.js documentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/frameworks/nextjs) for more information about using Storybook with Next.js

Similar to the Next.js application, Storybook can be ran natively or in a Docker container.

#### Native

From the `app/` directory:

1. `npm run storybook`
2. Navigate to [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view

##### Other scripts

- `npm run storybook-build` - Exports a static site to `storybook-static/`

#### Docker

Alternatively, you can run Storybook in a Docker container.

From the `app/` directory:

1. `make storybook`
2. Navigate to [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view

## üêõ Testing

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) is used as the test runner and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) provides React testing utilities.

Tests are manged as `.test.ts` (or `.tsx`) files in the the `tests/` directory.

To run tests:

- `npm test` - Runs all tests and outputs test coverage report
- `npm run test-update` - Updates test snapshots
- `npm run test-watch` - Runs tests in [watch](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--watch) mode. Tests will re-run when files are changed, and an interactive prompt will allow you to run specific tests or update snapshots.

A subset of tests can be ran by passing a pattern to the script. For example, to only run tests in `tests/pages/`:

```sh
npm run test-watch -- pages
```

## ü§ñ Type checking, linting, and formatting

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is used for type checking.
  - `npm run ts:check` - Type checks all files
  - `npm run i18n-types` - Updates the i18n TypeScript declaration. You only need to run this if you've added a new English locale file (JSON files in `public/locales/en-US`). This runs automatically when you start the development server or build the application.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is used for linting. This helps catch common mistakes and encourage best practices.
  - `npm run lint` - Lints all files and reports any errors
  - `npm run lint-fix` - Lints all files and fixes any auto-fixable errors
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for code formatting. This reduces the need for manual formatting or nitpicking and enforces a consistent style.
  - `npm run format`: Formats all files
  - `npm run format-check`: Check files for formatting violations without fixing them.

Optionally, configure your code editor to auto run these tools on file save. Most code editors have plugins for these tools or provide native support.

  <summary>VSCode instructions</summary>

1. Install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extensions.
2. Add the following to a `.vscode/settings.json` file, in whichever directory you open in VSCode (root or this directory):

   ```json
   {
     "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
       "source.fixAll.eslint": true
     },
     "editor.formatOnSave": true,
     "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
     "eslint.workingDirectories": ["./app"],
     "typescript.validate.enable": true
   }
   ```
